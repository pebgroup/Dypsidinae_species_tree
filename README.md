# Analysis of Dypsidinae target capture data

Wolf Eiserhardt (wolf.eiserhardt@bio.au.dk)

## Overview

This analysis of subtribe Dypsidinae was conducted at two levels:

1) A broad-scale, thinly sampled analysis of tribe Areceae to establish monophyly of subtribe Dypsidinae and identify one or several closely related subtribes/genera to be used as outgroups in the following species-level analysis. This analysis uses the PhyloPalms baits of [Loiseau et al. (2019)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2019.00864/full). 

A description of the pipeline for this analysis can be found [here](documentation/subtribes.md).

2) A narrower, species-level analysis of subtribe Dypsidinae plus _Loxococcus rupicola_ (Thwaites) H.Wendl. & Drude as an outgroup. This analysis uses the palm baits of [Heyduk et al. 2016](https://academic.oup.com/biolinnean/article/117/1/106/2440259).

A description of the pipeline for this analysis can be found [here](documentation/species.md).
